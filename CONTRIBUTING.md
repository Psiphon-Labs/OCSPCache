## Code contributions

### Contributor license agreement

When submitting a pull request for the first time, you will need to agree to the contributor license agreement (for [individuals](https://github.com/Psiphon-Labs/OCSPCache/blob/master/CLA-individual.md) or [entities](https://github.com/Psiphon-Labs/OCSPCache/blob/master/CLA-entity.md)). To do this, in the pull request please create a file with a name like `/contributors/{github_username}.md`, and in the content of that file indicate your agreement. An example of what that file should contain can be seen in [mirokuratczyk's agreement file](https://github.com/Psiphon-Labs/OCSPCache/blob/master/contributors/mirokuratczyk.md).

(This method of CLA "signing" is borrowed from [Medium's open source project](https://github.com/medium/opensource).)
